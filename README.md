# File Encryptor Using Fernet (Cryptography Library)


This Python-based tool encrypts and decrypts files using symmetric encryption (AES) provided by the `cryptography` library's `Fernet` module. It generates a unique encryption key, encrypts files with that key, and allows decryption using the same key. This project is simple, secure, and effective for managing sensitive files.

## Features

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) via the `Fernet` module.
- **Key Generation**: Generates a secure random key for file encryption.
- **File Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt any file using a key.
- **Key Storage**: Save and load the encryption key from a file for future use.
- **CLI Usage**: Easy command-line interface for encrypting and decrypting files.
